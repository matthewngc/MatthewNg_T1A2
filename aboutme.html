                <h3>My Journey</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                My career began in the winter of 2017, during my second year of university, when I started my first job in the wealth management industry.
                <br>
                Over the next 3 years, I continued to work in this industry while finishing my degree, hoping that I could figure out what kind of career I want after graduating.
                On the completion of my degree, I was still unsure about what kind of future career path I wanted to pursue.
                I landed a graduate role in which I grinded through a year and a half of unsatisfying and unfulfilling work before finally deciding to take control of my future, and make a start in something I've always had an interest in.
                <br>
                <br>
                In August of 2022, I resigned from my job and enrolled in Coder Academy, where I began the next chapter of my life in tech.

                <h3>Work & Study History</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I graduated from the University of New South Wales in 2020 with a Bachelor's degree in Actuarial Studies & Commerce, majoring in Finance and Accounting.
                <br>
                <br>
                    I got my first job in 2017 as an Account Manager at AMCO Strategic Financial Advice, where I assisted in the preparation and implementation of financial advice.
                    After one year, I moved to Moore Australia as a Para-planner, where I helped in providing high level financial advice to medium-to-high net worth clients by performing financial modelling and market research.
                    I stayed in this role for 2 years before starting as an associate with PwC Assurance, where I performed external audit procedures on large industry clients such as Sony Music Australia, Sony Interactive Australia and the Linde Group.

                <br>
                <p>
                    I am an avid sports fan, having played basketball and soccer competitively growing up. I also enjoy creating and listening to music, being proficient in piano, guitar and saxophone.
                    Outside of work, I like to travel, play video games, and spend quality time with friends and family.
