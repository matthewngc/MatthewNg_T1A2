            <h3>My Journey So Far</h3>
            <p>
            My career began in the winter of 2017, during my second year of university, when I started my first job in the wealth management industry 
            Over the next 3 years, I continued to work in this industry while finishing my degree, hoping that I could figure out what kind of career I want after graduating.
            On the completion of my degree, I was still unsure about what kind of future career path I wanted to pursue.
            I landed a graduate role in which I grinded through a year and a half of unhappiness and unfulfilling work before finally deciding to take control of my future, and make a start in something I've always had an interest in - tech.
            In August of 2022, I resigned from my job and enrolled in Coder Academy. Here is where my journey into tech begins!

            I got my first job in 2017 as an Account Manager at AMCO Strategic Financial Advice, where I assisted in the preparation and implementation of financial advice.
            After one year, I moved to Moore Australia as a Para-planner, where I helped in providing high level financial advice to medium-to-high net worth clients by performing financial modelling and market research.
            I stayed in this role for 2 years before starting as an associate with PwC Assurance, where I performed external audit procedures on large industry clients such as Sony Music Australia, Sony Interactive Australia and the Linde Group
